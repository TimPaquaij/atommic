## **ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke**

This project folder contains the configuration files, preprocessing, and visualization scripts for the
ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke dataset.

For more information, please refer to https://isles22.grand-challenge.org/dataset/.

**Note:** When running the preprocessing scripts please make sure you have the following packages installed: argparse,
connected-components-3d, json, nibabel, numpy, pathlib, random, simpleitk. All those packages, except the
connected-components-3d and simpleitk packages, are installed by default if atommic is installed. To install those two
packages, please run the following commands:
```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements-isles22.txt
```

### **Visualization**
An example notebook for visualizing the data is provided in the
[visualize.ipynb](projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/visualize.ipynb). You just need to set the path where
the dataset is downloaded. The notebook is copied and slightly modified from the
[original notebook](https://github.com/ezequieldlrosa/isles22/tree/main/utils) provided by the ISLES challenge.

### **Preprocessing**
The preprocessing pipeline is implemented in the
[preprocess_dataset.sh](projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/preprocess_dataset.sh) script, consisting of the
following steps:
1. Clip to 0 - max values.
2. Normalize the images to zero mean and unit variance.
3. Resample the FLAIR data to the same resolution as the ADC and DWI data.
4. Stack all modalities (ADC, DWI, FLAIR) into a single 3D volume.
5. Fix the orientation of the images.
6. Updates headers and save to NIfTI format.
7. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

The preprocessing script can be run with the following command:
```bash
./projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/preprocess_dataset.sh
```

### **Training/Testing**
For training a model, you just need to set up the data and export paths to the configuration file in
/projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/conf/train/ of the model you want to train. In `train_ds` and
`validation_ds` please set the `data_path` and the `segmentations_path`, which will be generated by the preprocessing
script. In `exp_manager` please set the `exp_dir` to the path where you want to save the model checkpoints and
tensorboard or wandb logs.

You can train a model with the following command:
`atommic run -c /projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/conf/train/{model}.yaml`

For testing a model, you just need to set up the data and export paths to the configuration file in
/projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/conf/test/ of the model you want to test. In `checkpoint`
(line 2) set the path the trained model checkpoint and in `test_ds` please set the `data_path`. In `exp_manager` please
set the `exp_dir` to the path where the predictions and logs will be saved.

You can test a model with the following command:
`atommic run -c /projects/segmentation/ISLES2022SubAcuteStroke/conf/test/{model}.yaml`

**Note:** The default logger is tensorboard.
